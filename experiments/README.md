Experiments are created using [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation)

We provide here the different training configuration files for training and testing a Swin Large model, together with the data 


For training the encoder-decoder, we set the learning rate at 0.0006.
For training the decoder only, we set the learning rate at 0.0003.
